# WARNING: this gitignore file uses a "whitelist" approach in
# which all files are ignored by default. Specific files and
# file types are then whitelisted for inclusion in the repository.
#

# Ignore everything by default.
# REMOVING OR COMMENTING OUT THE LINE BELOW IS FORBIDDEN
# IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES.
*

# Permit whitelisted file extensions in all directories.
# OPTIONAL: for added security, you may replace this whitelist
# with targeted directory whitelists. To do this, add the lines
# !$FOO/
# !$FOO/**/
# for each directory $FOO you wish to whitelist.
# If you do not understand what this means or are not confident
# in making such a change, then DO NOT modify the line below.

## other project-specific whitelist files
# Example: CSV with no secrets or PII used as synthetic data or for config.
# WARNINGS:
# - By adding a whitelist file, you are certifying that the file
#   contains no secrets or personally identifiable information, and you will
#   be held responsible for any breaches that result.
# - Do not whitelist with wildcards except with manager permission.
# - Do not whitelist Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb) or similar embedded-data files.

# Additional specific files to exclude:


# Additional sensitive-data directories (e.g., /output/, /explore/)


# Additional git-ignores based on common nuisance and personal directories and files,
# but are not strictly necessary for security, and are offered as suggestions.
# Ignore these directories and their contents, even if previous patterns
# would otherwise permit them.
